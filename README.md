ye olde dotfiles

todo: fill out this readme to isolate which lines and configs from each of the dotfiles relates specifically to the triple-monitor setup-tweaking (and what the positions, sizes, and orientations of those monitors are) vs. what is context-insensitive in the files.
todo: add any specificities desired for single-screen setups (i.e. laptop.)
